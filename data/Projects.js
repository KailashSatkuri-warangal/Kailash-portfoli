        description: 'Here are the IoT anomaly detection projects I have implemented that deals with the identification of cases that may indicate security breaches or hacks in IoT systems. The projects employ decision tree, random forest and linear regression to search for irregularities underlying the data: to detect any kind of intruding or malicious attempts. Through these models, the machine learning analysis of the accumulated IoT information and data helps the system to identify and even prevent unusual patterns so as to protect the assets of IoT devices and networks.',
